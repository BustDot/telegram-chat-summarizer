The text document below is a message history from a Telegram group chat.
I need you to summarize this chat history and yield primary conversation topics.
Each conversation topic mentioned should be accompanied by a one-sentence summaries of 2-3 most representative dialogs (not single messages) from the conversation on the given topic including user names. For each dialog summary provide the IDs of the messages that are most relevant to the point.
IMPORTANT: The output should be provided in the language which prevails in the messages text.

Output the result as a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
[
  {{
    "topic": "Topic Name",
    "participants": ["User1", "User2"],
    "discussion": [
      {{
        "point": "Summary of the discussion point",
        "key_message_ids": [123, 124, 125]
      }}
    ]
  }}
]
```

Here's an example of desired output in JSON format:

```json
[
  {{
    "topic": "Debugging late at night",
    "participants": ["Mike", "Sarah"],
    "discussion": [
      {{
        "point": "Mike jokes about how his code only works after midnight, suggesting a magical time for debugging.",
        "key_message_ids": [101, 102]
      }},
      {{
        "point": "Sarah laments the endless cycle of finding one bug only to encounter another.",
        "key_message_ids": [105]
      }}
    ]
  }},
  {{
    "topic": "The eternal debate between spaces and tabs",
    "participants": ["John", "Emily"],
    "discussion": [
      {{
        "point": "John passionately argues for spaces, citing consistency across different IDEs.",
        "key_message_ids": [201, 203]
      }}
    ]
  }}
]
```

Here's the JSON document:
